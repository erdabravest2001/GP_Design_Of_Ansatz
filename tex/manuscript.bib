	abstract={The trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) proposal1,2 lays out a blueprint for a universal quantum computer that uses mobile ions as qubits. Analogous to a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, which stores and processes imaging information as movable electrical charges in coupled pixels, a QCCD computer stores quantum information in the internal state of electrically charged ions that are transported between different processing zones using dynamic electric fields. The promise of the QCCD architecture is to maintain the low error rates demonstrated in small trapped-ion experiments3--5 by limiting the quantum interactions to multiple small ion crystals, then physically splitting and rearranging the constituent ions of these crystals into new crystals, where further interactions occur. This approach leverages transport timescales that are fast relative to the coherence times of the qubits, the insensitivity of the qubit states of the ion to the electric fields used for transport, and the low crosstalk afforded by spatially separated crystals. However, engineering a machine capable of executing these operations across multiple interaction zones with low error introduces many difficulties, which have slowed progress in scaling this architecture to larger qubit numbers. Here we use a cryogenic surface trap to integrate all necessary elements of the QCCD architecture---a scalable trap design, parallel interaction zones and fast ion transport---into a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer that has a system performance consistent with the low error rates achieved in the individual ion crystals. We apply this approach to realize a teleported CNOT gate using mid-circuit measurement6, negligible crosstalk error and a quantum volume7 of 26 = 64. These results demonstrate that the QCCD architecture provides a viable path towards high-performance quantum computers.},

Such systems provide insights into strongly correlated quantum matter2--6, while at the same time enabling new methods for computation7--10 and metrology11. Here we demonstrate a programmable quantum simulator based on deterministically prepared two-dimensional arrays of neutral atoms, featuring strong interactions controlled by coherent atomic excitation into Rydberg states12. Using this approach, we realize a quantum spin model with tunable interactions for system sizes ranging from 64 to 256 qubits. We benchmark the system by characterizing high-fidelity antiferromagnetically ordered states and demonstrating quantum critical dynamics consistent with an Ising quantum phase transition in (2 + 1) dimensions13. We then create and study several new quantum phases that arise from the interplay between interactions and coherent laser excitation14, experimentally map the phase diagram and investigate the role of quantum fluctuations. Offering a new lens into the study of complex quantum matter, these observations pave the way for investigations of exotic quantum phases, non-equilibrium entanglement dynamics and hardware-efficient realization of quantum algorithms.},

Moving forward, the challenge is to scale up to larger machines capable of performing computational tasks not possible today. This raises questions that need to be urgently addressed, such as what resources these machines will consume and how large will they be. Here we estimate the resources required to execute Shor's factoring algorithm on an atom-optics quantum computer architecture. We determine the runtime and size of the computer as a function of the problem size and physical error rate. Our results suggest that once the physical error rate is low enough to allow quantum error correction, optimization to reduce resources and increase performance will come mostly from integrating algorithms and circuits within the error correction environment, rather than from improving the physical hardware.},

	abstract={Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"a}tze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry---calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He--H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

	abstract = {Many quantum algorithms have daunting resource requirements when compared to what is available today. To address this discrepancy, a quantum-classical hybrid optimization scheme known as ‘the quantum variational eigensolver’ was developed (Peruzzo et al 2014 Nat. Commun. 5 4213) with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through a relaxation of exponential operator splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.}

In contrast to analogue quantum simulation, this approach forgoes the requirement of realizing the targeted Hamiltonian directly in the laboratory, thus enabling the study of a wide variety of previously intractable target models. We focus on the lattice Schwinger model, a gauge theory of one-dimensional quantum electrodynamics. Our quantum co-processor is a programmable, trapped-ion analogue quantum simulator with up to 20 qubits, capable of generating families of entangled trial states respecting the symmetries of the target Hamiltonian. We determine ground states, energy gaps and additionally, by measuring variances of the Schwinger Hamiltonian, we provide algorithmic errors for the energies, thus taking a step towards verifying quantum simulation.},

In this paper, we study the application of VQE to the simulation of molecular energies using the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz. We introduce new strategies to reduce the circuit depth for the implementation of UCC and improve the optimization of the wavefunction based on efficient classical approximations of the cluster amplitudes. Additionally, we propose an analytical method to compute the energy gradient that reduces the sampling cost for gradient estimation by several orders of magnitude compared to numerical gradients. We illustrate our methodology with numerical simulations for a system of four hydrogen atoms that exhibit strong correlation and show that the circuit depth of VQE using a UCC ansatz can be reduced without introducing significant loss of accuracy in the final wavefunctions and energies.}

The variational quantum eigensolver, a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware, has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies. Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that, instead of fixing an ansatz upfront, grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters, leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations, including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach, in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of our adaptive algorithm for exact simulations with present-day and near-term quantum hardware.},

The practical realization is limited by the complexity of quantum circuits. Here we present an approach to reduce quantum circuit complexity in VQE for electronic structure calculations. Our ClusterVQE algorithm splits the initial qubit space into clusters which are further distributed on individual (shallower) quantum circuits. The clusters are obtained based on mutual information reflecting maximal entanglement between qubits, whereas inter-cluster correlation is taken into account via a new ``dressed'' Hamiltonian. ClusterVQE therefore allows exact simulation of the problem by using fewer qubits and shallower circuit depth at the cost of additional classical resources, making it a potential leader for quantum chemistry simulations on NISQ devices. Proof-of-principle demonstrations are presented for several molecular systems based on quantum simulators as well as IBM quantum devices.},

While several algorithms exist for efficiently solving the electronic structure problem on a quantum computer{,} there has been comparatively little attention devoted to solving the vibrational structure problem with quantum hardware.

The surfaces for interaction with alkali-metal atoms have deep wells dominated by covalent forces. The resulting strong anisotropies will produce strongly inelastic collisions. The surfaces for interaction with alkaline-earth atoms have shallower wells that are dominated by induction and dispersion forces. For Be and Mg the anisotropy is small compared to the rotational constant of NH{,} so that collisions will be relatively weakly inelastic. Be and Mg are thus promising coolants for sympathetic cooling of NH to the ultracold regime."}

The variational quantum eigensolver, a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware, has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies. Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that, instead of fixing an ansatz upfront, grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters, leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations, including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach, in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of our adaptive algorithm for exact simulations with present-day and near-term quantum hardware.},

abstract = {Summary The theory of molecular structure is based on the separation of scales. The diatomic molecules possess a cylindrical symmetry, which means that the rotation of the molecule about the axis joining the two atoms must leave the properties of the molecular system unchanged. The patterns of the rotational energy levels depend on the Hund's case. For each vibrational state, there are multiple rotational states, and the energy splittings between the rotational states are much smaller than the energy gaps between different vibrational states. The chapter deals with three types of hyperfine interactions in diatomic molecules: the Fermi contact interaction, the long-range magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, and the interaction between the electric quadrupole moments of the nuclei and the gradient of the electric field generated by the charged particles within the molecule. The molecular states are the eigenstates of the parity operator with the eigenvalues.}

Assuming that the potential energy matrix is diagonal on the grid destroys the variational principle in the Fourier and DVR methods. In the present article we (1) demonstrate that the extra grid points in the generalized discrete variable representation (GDVR) act as dealiasing functions that restore the variational principle and make a pseudospectral calculation equivalent to a purely spectral one, (2) describe the general principles for extending the GDVR to other nondirect product spectral bases of orthogonal polynomials, and (3) establish the relation between the GDVR and the least squares method exploited in the pseudospectral electronic structure and adiabatic pseudospectral bound state calculations of Friesner and collaborators.}",

title={An Empirical Comparison of Optimizers for Quantum Machine Learning with SPSA-based Gradients},

abstract={VQA have attracted a lot of attention from the quantum computing community  for the last few years. Their hybrid quantum-classical nature with relatively  shallow quantum circuits makes them a promising platform for demonstrating the  capabilities of NISQ devices. Although the classical machine learning community  focuses on gradient-based parameter optimization, finding near-exact gradients  for VQC with the parameter-shift rule introduces a large sampling overhead.  Therefore, gradient-free optimizers have gained popularity in quantum machine  learning circles. Among the most promising candidates is the SPSA algorithm,  due to its low computational cost and inherent noise resilience. We introduce a  novel approach that uses the approximated gradient from SPSA in combination  with state-of-the-art gradient-based classical optimizers. We demonstrate  numerically that this outperforms both standard SPSA and the parameter-shift  rule in terms of convergence rate and absolute error in simple regression  tasks. The improvement of our novel approach over SPSA with stochastic gradient  decent is even amplified when shot- and hardware-noise are taken into account.  We also demonstrate that error mitigation does not significantly affect our  results.},

Utilisant un exemple clair, nous montrons que la reduction en cout du circuit ameliore la fidelite de l'etat de sortie (par rapport a l'etat theoriquement attendu en l'absence de bruit), puisque les baisses du nombre de portes et de la complexite des circuits introduisent moins d'erreur pendant l'evolution de l'etat.

It uses the variational principle to compute the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian, a problem that is central to quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics.

The variational property implies that the optimal of the subsets of a fixed number of points, i.e., the subset which gives the possible highest accuracy eigenpairs, gives the DVR of the smallest trace. The symmetry properties of the variational FBR/DVR Hamiltonian operator are analyzed and methods to incorporate symmetry into FBR/DVR calculations are discussed. It is shown how the Fourier-basis FBR/DVR suitable to solving periodic systems arise within the theory presented. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results. The use of variational effective Hamiltonian and coordinate operators has been instrumental in this study. They have been introduced in a novel way by exploiting quasi-Hermiticity.},

abstract={Phys. Rev. A 105, 042406 (2022) Zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) is a widely used technique for gate error

mitigation on near term quantum computers because it can be implemented in

software and does not require knowledge of the quantum computer noise

parameters. Traditional ZNE requires a significant resource overhead in terms

of quantum operations. A recent proposal using a targeted (or random) instead

of fixed identity insertion method (RIIM versus FIIM) requires significantly

fewer quantum gates for the same formal precision. We start by showing that

RIIM can allow for ZNE to be deployed on deeper circuits than FIIM, but

requires many more measurements to maintain the same statistical uncertainty.

We develop two extensions to FIIM and RIIM. The List Identity Insertion Method

(LIIM) allows to mitigate the error from certain CNOT gates, typically those

with the largest error. Set Identity Insertion Method (SIIM) naturally

interpolates between the measurement-efficient FIIM and the gate-efficient

RIIM, allowing to trade off fewer CNOT gates for more measurements. Finally, we

investigate a way to boost the number of measurements, namely to run ZNE in

parallel, utilizing as many quantum devices as are available. We explore the

performance of RIIM in a parallel setting where there is a non-trivial spread

in noise across sets of qubits within or across quantum computers.;Zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) is a widely used technique for gate error mitigation on near term quantum computers because it can be implemented in software and does not require knowledge of the quantum computer noise parameters.

title={Zero noise extrapolation on logical qubits by scaling the error correction code distance},

abstract={In this work, we migrate the quantum error mitigation technique of Zero-Noise  Extrapolation (ZNE) to fault-tolerant quantum computing. We employ ZNE on  \emph{logically encoded} qubits rather than \emph{physical} qubits. This  approach will be useful in a regime where quantum error correction (QEC) is  implementable but the number of qubits available for QEC is limited. Apart from  illustrating the utility of a traditional ZNE approach (circuit-level unitary  folding) for the QEC regime, we propose a novel noise scaling ZNE method  specifically tailored to QEC: \emph{distance scaled ZNE (DS-ZNE)}. DS-ZNE  scales the distance of the error correction code, and thereby the resulting  logical error rate, and utilizes this code distance as the scaling `knob' for  ZNE. Logical qubit error rates are scaled until the maximum achievable code  distance for a fixed number of physical qubits, and lower error rates (i.e.,  effectively higher code distances) are achieved via extrapolation techniques  migrated from traditional ZNE. Furthermore, to maximize physical qubit  utilization over the ZNE experiments, logical executions at code distances  lower than the maximum allowed by the physical qubits on the quantum device are  parallelized to optimize device utilization. We validate our proposal with  numerical simulation and confirm that ZNE lowers the logical error rates and  increases the effective code distance beyond the physical capability of the  quantum device. For instance, at a physical code distance of 11, the DS-ZNE  effective code distance is 17, and at a physical code distance of 13, the  DS-ZNE effective code distance is 21. When the proposed technique is compared  against unitary folding ZNE under the constraint of a fixed number of  executions of the quantum device, DS-ZNE outperforms unitary folding by up to  92\% in terms of the post-ZNE logical error rate.},
